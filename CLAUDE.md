# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

A Kalico (Klipper fork) plugin adding support for hotendchanger 3D printers: a toolchanger
variant that swaps only the hotend assembly (heater block, thermistor, nozzle, hotend fan)
between docks. The extruder motor, filament drive, and part cooling fan stay fixed on the
carriage; each docked hotend keeps its own filament loaded, so a tool change is purely
mechanical motion plus an electrical remap of heater/thermistor/fan to the active hotend.
No filament retract or handoff is involved.

## The plugin: Python, Kalico klippy plugin

Installed by symlink into Kalico's gitignored `klippy/plugins/` directory, or stock
Klipper's `klippy/extras/` (config section name = module name in both). Targets Kalico
and stock Klipper: firmware differences are capability-detected at runtime (check for
the surface, fall back otherwise), never firmware-identified.

Commands (repo root):

```bash
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
python -m pytest tests/            # unit tests
```

Durable gotchas:
- Inside `klippy/plugins/`, cross-module imports must use the full namespace
  (`from klippy.extras import heaters`), never relative imports.
- A local `kalico/` reference clone (if present) may be newer than the printer this runs on.
  Reading an attribute, option or method there proves it exists in current Kalico, not in the
  owner's build. Before depending on any Kalico surface, establish when it was added and reach
  it defensively if it postdates the target build. Tests cannot catch this: they never import
  klippy, so every Kalico-facing line is proven only on hardware.
- An unexpected exception in a gcode handler is not an error message, it is a printer shutdown.
  Klipper's dispatcher only catches `CommandError`, so an `AttributeError` or a `KeyError`
  reaches the bare handler and shuts the machine down mid-command.

## Conventions

Numbered for unambiguous reference; do not cite rule numbers in shipped source or UI text.

1. **Integrity: established methods only, never a fudge.** Every algorithm and control behavior
   is an established method, named with provenance in comments where ported. NEVER introduce a
   hand-tuned constant, empirical offset, or bias correction fitted to make one particular
   setup's numbers look right: that overfits the sample and lies on the next one. Tunable
   tolerances are config parameters, exposed and documented, not buried magic numbers.

2. **No silently swallowed errors.** An `except` must surface the error, rethrow, or return a
   value the caller can act on. Every failure path a user can hit raises a gcode error with an
   actionable message naming the likely cause.

3. **Keep core logic framework-agnostic and modular.** Pure logic takes plain values and
   imports nothing from klippy; the plugin class is the only klippy-facing layer. New modes or
   hardware variants are their own modules behind clear interfaces.

4. **NO AI attribution in git/GitHub; no AI process residue in any output.** A
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude <...>` trailer NEVER allowed on commits. No AI attribution anywhere.
   Commit messages: a single short sentence. Shipped output of every kind (source code,
   comments, docstrings, docs, UI text, error messages, commit messages) must never reference
   the AI-assisted process behind it: no mention of these rules or their numbers ("per rule
   2"), CLAUDE.md, skills, agents, subagents, prompts, reviews by agents, or session context.
   Rationale is expressed in plain domain terms instead. The reader of any shipped file must
   find no evidence of how it was produced.

5. **Commit approval.** The owner granted standing approval to commit at will on `main`
   (2026-07-30). Pushes still require explicit approval.

6. **Never use the em-dash character**, and never a hyphen as a substitute for it. Rewrite with
   a colon, parentheses, a comma, or two sentences. Hyphens only where grammar requires
   (compound modifiers).

7. **UI text is plain technical prose; terminology is the Klipper/Voron community's.** Complete
   grammatical sentences in docs and error messages, neutral register. Terms as the ecosystem
   names them (toolhead, nozzle offset, probe, macro, config section, print_time); one term per
   concept. Gcode command names follow Klipper convention (UPPER_SNAKE, parameters `T=`, `Z=`).

8. **Diagnostic readouts show raw values** as labeled rows, not prose sentences.

9. **Never corrupt reported values.** Printed values reflect the actual state or measurement
   exactly; no rounding beyond documented display precision, no silent clamping, no "helpful"
   adjustments. An operation that fails validation is reported as failed, never as a plausible
   success.

10. **Extend the concept's existing home; never bolt a duplicate beside a symptom.** Before
    adding a function, a predicate, a record, a readout row or a derived value, search the file
    for every identifier the new code touches (attribute names, dict keys, constants, format
    strings), read every hit, and extend what they show; if the concept has no home, create
    exactly one. Specifically: never restate the members of a closed set as a literal at a use
    site, never recompute a value the caller already holds, and never answer inline a question
    an existing predicate already answers. Read the set, take the argument, call the predicate.
    When the search finds a twin, unify it in the same change: that is in scope by definition,
    and twins that disagree are a bug fix, not a cleanup to schedule. Reuse Kalico's own
    machinery (heaters, fans, gcode_move, existing toolchanger patterns) instead of
    reimplementing it. Any non-trivial or cross-cutting change gets a short written design first
    (its canonical home, what it extends, what it must not duplicate) for owner approval before
    implementation; a delegating prompt names the home the task must extend whenever one exists.
    Interim ("quick fix now, proper fix later") solutions are forbidden in all cases: the
    correct structure is built immediately, even when it costs a schema change or a larger diff.
    The task reports each definition, record and readout row it added, with the symbol it
    extended or the searches that returned nothing.

11. **Subagent discipline.** Give every subagent a correct, specific title; never run more than
    1 Fable agent at a time (hard budget limit). Sonnet is fine for parallel design/research
    work. Only Anthropic/Claude agents: never route work to cross-vendor lanes (grok/codex).
    The main (user-facing) agent edits repository files itself only for tiny changes (a single
    line); anything larger is performed by a subagent. The main agent also delegates other
    context-heavy work and consumes only conclusions: codebase exploration and broad searches,
    reading large files or external references, and reviews/audits. The main agent keeps for
    itself only what needs conversation context or judgment: talking to the owner, design
    decisions, writing the subagent prompts, running tests to verify outcomes, and git commits.
    Exceptions where the main agent may edit directly: CLAUDE.md and the memory directory
    (meta-configuration the owner asks for), and reverting a file with git. When delegating
    implementation, the prompt must be self-contained (files, constraints, conventions,
    definition of done, exact interfaces or design decisions already made); iterative design
    loops with the owner are still driven by the main agent, which re-delegates each round with
    the updated instructions rather than editing directly because the round feels small.

12. **Exhaustive dispatch over closed sets.** Any branch on a closed set (command parameters,
    tool states, status codes the plugin claims to handle) must handle every member explicitly
    and end in an explicit "unhandled" path (raise, or log-and-skip per rule 2). Never write an
    `else` that assumes whatever is left: it silently absorbs members added later.

13. **Test oracles must be independent of the logic they judge.** A test's expected value comes
    from a source the implementation cannot contaminate: constructed scenarios with known
    outcomes assert those literal outcomes within tolerance. Never compute the expectation by
    calling, copying, or paraphrasing the code under test: a test that mirrors the
    implementation passes when both are wrong and verifies nothing. This is the deliberate
    exception to rule 10: oracle values are duplicated on purpose. Self-consistency checks are
    legitimate but must never be presented as correctness evidence on their own.

14. **No invented defaults for setup-specific values.** A config option whose correct value
    depends on the user's machine (coordinates, pins, tool count, offsets) gets NO default in
    code or docs: it is a required option the user must provide, and the config reference shows
    it blank. Defaults exist only for values we can genuinely know (protocol constants,
    algorithm tunables with provenance, driver defaults that are correct for the documented
    hardware). A wrong-looking example number presented as a default teaches users to keep it.

15. **A comment states what the code cannot.** A new comment or docstring line is allowed only
    as: (a) provenance, citing the source file and line of a ported algorithm or a depended-on
    Kalico behaviour; (b) a physical or API constraint unreadable from the code (hardware
    behaviour, a timing assumption, a deliberate deviation and why); (c) the reason an
    "unhandled" branch exists. Everything else is forbidden, specifically: restating what the
    next line or block does, arguing that a change is an improvement, narrating what was deleted
    or added, describing the shape of a fix, and docstrings that paraphrase the function name or
    signature. Code needing a paragraph to follow gets rewritten, not annotated. Every comment
    must be able to name its category, a provenance comment cites its file and line, and a
    comment that cannot name its category is deleted, no argument from usefulness. This binds
    task instructions too: a task's rationale belongs in a section marked as context, not
    instruction; the instruction itself stays imperative; and the task reports how many comment
    lines it added, so an over-explained result is visible without reading the diff.

**Verification bar.** `python -m pytest tests/` green before any feature is declared finished.
Final acceptance for hardware-facing changes is a run on the owner's real printer, verified by
the owner.
